Pimp My Z1
==========

Pimp My Z1 is a sleek, holo, fully Open-Source (GPL v2 license) app which allows to control various sysfs interfaces present on some kernels for the Z1.
Most features require either [Pimped Kernel](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2660679) (for CM-based roms) or [Doom Kernel](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2448613) (for Stock-based roms), but the CPU & GPU Control as well as Touch Screen control will work properly with any kernel including the stock one.
